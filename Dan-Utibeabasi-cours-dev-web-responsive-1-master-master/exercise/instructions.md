## Planning

- 13/10/2022 and 20/10/2022: Lessons on responsive design and web frontend development for mobile.

This exercise will be used to evaluate the 2 lessons. I will put a small grade (over 5 points).

It is to be submitted for the 12th november 2022 at midnight.

## Submission procedure

You can either send me your assignment via gitlab : 

- Make a new gitlab project on your favorite gitlab instance
- If you are git-savvy enough, replace the remote of the repository
with your own remote
- Otherwise, remove the `.git` folder, and initialize a new git repository
in the assignment directory, then put it online like you would do with a new
project
- Make sure I have access to your online gitlab repository (the best is to make it public)
- Send me the link, I take the last commit before the deadline date, or a specific
commit if you tell me which one.


Or you can send it to me via email :
- ZIP your project directory
- Send it to qrichaud.pro@gmail.com


# Assignment

In the `integration` directory, you have a working implementation of the desktop mockup for the Musicca "about" webpage.

There are 2 mockups that represent how the website should look on a mobile webpage (screen size <= 480px).

Modify the existing integration, in order to make the webpage reponsive. The desktop version should not change, however, when
displaying on a screen size smaller than 480px, the webpage should look the same as the mockups.

You will need to use javascipt to create a menu button that toggles the mobile menu visibility.
